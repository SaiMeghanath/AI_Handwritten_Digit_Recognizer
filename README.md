# AI_Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
AI Handwritten Digit Recognizer 🖊️🔢 This project is a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It also includes a Gradio-powered web app where users can draw a digit, and the AI will predict it in real time.   
This project is a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset**. The model is deployed as an interactive web application using **Gradio**, allowing users to draw a digit and get predictions in real time.
