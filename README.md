# AI_Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
AI Handwritten Digit Recognizer 🖊️🔢 This project is a deep learning model that recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It also includes a Gradio-powered web app where users can draw a digit, and the AI will predict it in real time.
